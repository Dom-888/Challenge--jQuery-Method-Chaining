# Contains three Codeinstitute challenges designed to explore jQuery events

<br>

## First Challenge

Write jQuery in script.js file and add CSS to the style.css file to make the following changes to the blue button in the button.html file.
Apply the following behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

- Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).
- Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.
- On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.
- On mouseleave reverse the above.
- Use method chaining to achieve the above.

## Second Challenge

- Use hide() / show() and fadeIn() / fadeOut() on button click. Create a second button and paragraph. Run the code and click on the buttons.

You will notice that both buttons perform the same action on both paragraphs. Even if you mouse over one button, both are highlighted (if you still have the mouseover code). Why? Because for now, our jQuery code says so.

## Third Challenge

- Go to eir.ie Using Developer tools to change all the links (hrefs) so they point to codeinstitute.net.
